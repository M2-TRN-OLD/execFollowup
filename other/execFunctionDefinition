Executive function -- how to plan, organize, remember, and carry out tasks as well as manage emotions -- is tied closely to success in school and life. From managing projects to completing work to just showing up on time, executive function skills make us more productive and successful, not to mention conscientious and collaborative. Just about everyone struggles with these skills, and some students face significant challenges. While tech doesn't solve executive function challenges, these apps and sites will help students get on the right path, whether they're in preschool or high school, just need a little extra help, or have special needs.
